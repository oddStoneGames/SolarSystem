## Introduction 

This is a WIP project that aims to render solar system with all the planets orbiting around the sun.    

### Features
- PBR Workflow (Physically Based Rendering)
- Deferred & Forward Lighting
- MSAA (Multisample Anti Aliasing)
- Bloom
- Tone Mapping
- HDR Rendering
- .glTF Model Loader

## Setup 
 
Prerequisites: [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with [git large file storage (git-lfs)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

Clone the repo using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/oddStoneGames/SolarSystem.git
cd SolarSystem
```

## Build 
 
### Supported Platforms  
- Windows
- Linux

### Dependencies 
 
- Hardware with support for OpenGL 4.2 Core
- CMake v3.10+
- C++17 Compiler 
- On Linux, these [libraries](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html) are required to build GLFW

### Build with CMake 
 
`Step 1.` Make a directory for the build files.

```
mkdir build
```

`Step 2.` Generate the project files.

```
cmake -S . -B ./build
```

`Step 3.` Build the project.

```
cmake --build build --config Release --target SolarSystem
```
`Step 4.` Run the executable SolarSystem which is located in the build or build/Release folder.
